## Releasing
- Bump the version, unless told otherwise only bump the most minor number (e.g. 0.1.0a1->0.1.0a2, 0.1.0->0.1.1)
- Make sure all changes are committed atomically including the version bump
- Create a PR fully detailing all changes since the last PR
- Merge the PR (ask if you weren't explicitly told to)
- Create a release detailing all changes, bug fixes, and new features (ask if you weren't told to)
